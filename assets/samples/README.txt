Add real strum samples here to improve sound quality.

Supported files:
- assets/samples/strum1.mp3
- assets/samples/strum2.mp3
- assets/samples/strum3.mp3

Drop short strum recordings (one-shot) in MP3 or WAV format with a duration ~0.2-1.5s. The app will preload any of the filenames above if present and use them when you click 'Tocar' in the Cifras viewer.

Tips:
- Use mono samples for best results.
- Normalize volume to avoid clipping.
- If you don't have samples, you can record a short acoustic strum on your phone and rename it to one of the filenames.
